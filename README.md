# Project Ignite 2018 Video Game AI Group

This was a project done by Otis Smith, Jack Cameron, Will Aracri, Kyle Carskadden, Trey Natili, and Thomas Chang over a ten week period through Carnegie Mellon University's Project Ignite, with the assistance of Brian Scheuermann, Tiffany Ma, and Tyler Sikov. The project was presented at a showcase event at CMU in April, 2018. 

The project was split into two main portions, programming an alpha-beta algorithm to play Connect 4, and using reinforcement learning to play simple simulations (CartPole and Pendulum) from OpenAI's Gym. Although both portions are present in this repository, only the neural network section will be discussed in the readme. 

## Prerequisites

Before trying to run any of the files, make sure that Python 3, TensorFlow, and OpenAI Gym are all installed properly. See the individual product websites for each for installation instructions. 

## Using These Files

Given that much of the work relies solely on Python, TensorFlow, and Gym, little else is needed to run the files if these three are properly installed. Simply download the repository and run the .py files in the folder titled OpenAI_Gym_TensorFlow. 

The file named "CartPole.py" runs a few random input tests in a window, collects data, and trains a neural network based on those trials which scored well (according to the built in reward system in Gym). The second set of trials is the outputs generated by the neural network after it has been trained. Because the pole balances much better, the neural network was deemed successful in optimizing this situation.

The file named "pendulum.py" runs similarly, with the only difference being that the simulation is now the Pendulum simulation. The result after training is only marginally better, unfortunately, but does seem to have some improvement over random input. With more training time and adjustment of the neural network, results could likely be improved.

# Project Ignite 2018 Video Game AI Group

This was a project done by Otis Smith, Jack Cameron, Will Aracri, Kyle Carskadden, Trey Natili, and Thomas Chang over a ten week period through Carnegie Mellon University's Project Ignite, with the assistance of Brian Scheuermann, Tiffany Ma, and Tyler Sikov. The project was presented at a showcase event at CMU in April, 2018. 

The project was split into two main portions, programming an alpha-beta algorithm to play Connect 4, and using reinforcement learning to play simple simulations (CartPole and Pendulum) from OpenAI's Gym.
